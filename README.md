# AcousticModem

In this project we were able to implement a receiver for an acoustic modem. We created an acoustic modem
that sends a digital signal using sound waves that use amplitude modulation to transmit them. After some
reconstruction, filtering, and interpretation of the signal, we are able to decode any message contained in an
acoustic signal.
